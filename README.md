# 12586269025 
  A fork of [9007199254740992](https://github.com/DmitryKuzmenko/2048) by Dmitry Kuzmenko.  I thought it would be nice to try the same game mechanics for other mathematical sequences... This one is using Fibonacci sequences. Next up will be a version using prime factors.

Made just for fun. [Play it here!](https://thereal96.github.io/12586269025/)

## Notes on gameplay
For fairly obvious reasons, I ommitted the 0 tile, and randomly generate ones and threes.  (Generating twos would be a bit pointless...) I tweaked the probablilities to make it challenging enough yet not too frustrating.  With the current settings, in my experience, 12586269025 is quite achievable, but I have not managed to get it to 20365011074 more than once.

Try setting the probability to 75% for a bit more of a challange.
