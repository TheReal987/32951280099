# 32951280099 
  A fork of [9007199254740992](https://github.com/DmitryKuzmenko/2048) by Dmitry Kuzmenko.  I thought it would be nice to try the same game mechanics for other mathematical sequences... This one is using Fibonacci sequences. Next up will be a version using prime factors.

Made just for fun. [Play it here!](https://thereal987.github.io/32951280099/)

## Notes on gameplay
For fairly obvious reasons, I ommitted the 0 tile, and randomly generate ones and threes.  (Generating twos would be a bit pointless...) I tweaked the probablilities to make it challenging enough yet not too frustrating.  With the current settings, in my experience, 32951280099 is quite achievable, but I have not managed to get it to 53316291173 more than once.

Try setting the probability to 85% for a bit more of a challange.
